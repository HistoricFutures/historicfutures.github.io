                <p>Knowing where products come from and how they got here is
                important – to consumers, to companies, to regulators, and to
                the planet.</p>

                immediate suppliers handle finished products</span></li>

                complies with relevant regulations, product claims and customer
                expectations</span></li>

                <li><span>You need to know that those who helped make your
                product were fairly treated, and not just in the factory you
                bought from</span></li>

                <p>We make it possible for companies to collect and manage
                value chain data, from primary production to finished product
                and to communicate good practice to their customers.</p>

                <p>We work with any product, anywhere in the value chain, and
                don't judge specifications ("organic", "Fair Trade", "GMO"
                etc.) Our mission is to create a framework to measure value
                chain performance rather than define what that performance
                should be.</p>

                <h3>It's not impossible</h3>

                <p>The lack of accurate and complete information about the
                history of individual products makes informed sourcing
                decisions and reliable product claims impossible.</p>

                <p>We know that getting that information is hard to do, but it
                is possible - we’ve done it.</p>

                <p>We are currently working on a new solution, researching
                radically improved mechanisms for increasing the scale and
                efficiency of value chain mapping. Reducing the cost, expanding
                the reach and improving the benefits for all.</p>

                <p>We believe that value chain maps can unlock real business
                value. Understanding a product’s history reduces risk and
                provides an important and powerful opportunity to create
                sustainable value.</p>

                <h2>Our story</h2>

                <p>Over the last ten years we have worked with some of the
                world’s largest brands and retailers to collect accurate data
                about millions of items from thousands of businesses throughout
                hundreds of value chains - from finished product back to raw
                material.</p>

                <p>We developed an online solution, called <a href=
                "http://stringtogether.com" title=
                "Visit the String website">String</a>, that allows
                organisations throughout the value chain to share selected
                information related to the products they make with the
                customers who buy them.</p>

                <p>String can be used to join the outputs from one organisation
                to the inputs of the next - building dynamic, accurate value
                chain maps for any product, no matter how complex.</p>
