            from today.</p>
                
            <p>Collecting reliable, up-to-date information from supply chains is 
            surprisingly difficult. <a href="#whatwedo" title=

            help them understand the data they need collect to deliver the benefits 
            they seek. We also work to design, develop and deploy tools to improve 
            the management of value chain data, from primary production to finished 
            product.</p>

                <p>Knowing where products come from and how they got here is
                important – to consumers, to companies, to regulators, and to
                the planet.</p>

        <div class="bricks">
            <ul class="bricks-1">
                <li><span>You need to know that those who helped make your
                product were fairly treated, and not just in the factory
                you bought from</span></li>
                    
                <li><span>You need to check that the product in your hand
                complies with relevant regulations, product claims and customer
                expectations</span></li>

                <li><span>You need to show that your product needed less energy

                <p>We work with companies to provide strategies, frameworks and
                tools to assess the products they purchase. The assessment may
                be for legal compliance (e.g. Modern Slavery Act, EUTR etc.), for
                business improvement (strategic sourcing, portfolio rationalisation etc.)
                or for product development (embedded energy, water footprint etc.)</p>

                <p>We work with any product. Our mission is to create a framework to
                measure value chain performance rather than define what that performance
                should be.</p>

                <h3>It's not impossible</h3>

                <p>The lack of accurate and complete information about the history of 
                individual products makes informed sourcing decisions and reliable product 
                claims impossible.</p>

                <p>We know that getting that information is hard to do, but it is possible
                - we’ve done it. Over the past 14 years we have worked with some of the
                world’s largest brands and retailers on ground breaking projects –
                delivering unique insight into how global supply chain networks operate.</p>

                <p>We continue to pioneer new approaches. We focused on a simple solution
                for supply chain risk management with the design of 
                <a href="http://getstring3.com" title="Find out more about String3">String3</a>.

                <p>We believe that value chain maps can unlock real business
                value. Understanding a product’s history reduces risk and
                provides an important and powerful opportunity to create
                sustainable value.</p>

                <p>Over the last 14 years we have worked with some of the world’s largest brands and retailers to collect accurate data about millions of items from thousands of businesses throughout hundreds of value chains - from finished product back to raw material.</p>

                <p>Along the way we have worked with our customers from idea to implementation – ranging across brand strategy, corporate risk, procurement processes, solution implementation and training. We’ve learned to keep it simple, and to focus on the people involved – throughout the supply chain. </p>
