  <p>The UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 has many implications for your business, but few requirements. You just have to make a statement, signed by a Director and publish it on your website. All simple enough, but your statement will send important messages to many stakeholders in your business - from shareholders to customers, staff to contractors. Your reputation is on the line.</p>

  <p>It is critically important that you review your hiring practices for employees, and evaluate the processes and controls your your contractors have in place. But for most businesses, the greatest threat to their reputation is embedded in the products they sell to their customers. Your product catalogue might be sourced from hundreds of suppliers - and each one has their own upstream supply chain, extending all over the world. Your products represent your brand, and they involve thousands of businesses - and they are in-scope for your evaluation of Modern Slavery risks.</p>

  <p>Historic Futures are recognised experts in supply chain mapping and responsible sourcing. We have worked with many of the world’s largest  brands and retailers to define strategies and implement practical solutions to managing risk in global supply chains. If you need help with building risk frameworks (to identify those products where modern slavery is most likely) and portfolio sampling strategies (to choose which ones to work on first), or are looking for practical methods to obtain reliable data from your extended supply chain to help evaluate risk <a href="mailto:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#104;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#105;&#99;&#102;&#117;&#116;&#117;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">get in touch with us</a> today.</p>
