<h2>Thank you to all those who attended our workshop</h2>
			<p>We hope you enjoyed the day as much as we did.</p>
			<p>The post it notes from the morning session are up on our office wall - getting sorted note by note. We will keep you updated with the themes and priorities that emerge as we do this.  We hope to send you a summary within the month.</p>

<!--<p>Value chain mapping allows you to get accurate answers to questions about your products. We’re building String3, a technology tool that can be used to join the outputs from one organisation to the inputs of the next - building value chain maps that are always up to date, for any product, no matter how complex.</p>
<ul class="list-group">
	<li>When you need to know the country of origin of your product’s raw materials</li>
	<li>When you need to show that those who helped make your product were fairly treated, and not just in the factory you bought from</li>
	<li>When you need to demonstrate that your product used less energy and water to make</li>
	<li>When you need to prove that your product was actually ‘made’ in the country stated on the label (and not just exported from it)</li>
	<li>When you need to understand possible impacts on product viability from climate change or legislation</li>
</ul>

<p>The key to these and many other questions is knowing who has the best answers. We are working to explore what data is needed from the value chain to get answers that are valuable.</p>

<p>The one day workshop will explore the business cases for value chain maps. What benefits will it provide? What are the challenges? What alternatives are there?
</p>

<p>We will specifically focus on direct financial value as well as social and environmental value. We will also explore some key issues and misconceptions around information sharing.</p>-->
