excerpt: The greatest component of the environmental impact of a product is often not its use, but its production. In some cases the global value chain can account for up to 80% of the total impact. While it is clear that this will vary significantly from one product to another, it seems logical that the process of making something can use more resources and affect more systems than using it.
