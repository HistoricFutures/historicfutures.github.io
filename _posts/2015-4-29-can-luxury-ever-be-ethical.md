excerpt: How can companies in the luxury segment be responsible? For a long time it has been assumed that companies producing luxury articles are immune to concerns about wider societal concerns and business responsibility in general. Images of exclusivity and conspicuousness of consumption are associated to this idea; social and environmental concerns, this view goes, are alien to luxury. For example, experiments in the garments industry have suggested that to explicitly include recycled material in luxury clothes reduces their value, rather than adds to it.
