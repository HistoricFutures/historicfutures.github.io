excerpt: "During the large-scale implementation of Historic Futuresâ€™ String2 technology we signed-up and trained users in more than 700 different organisations forming part of the global supply chain of a major UK brand. Towards the end of the project, we noticed a significant trend. If we prepared information for a String2 user that compared their use of the tool (more accurately, the performance of the organisation they worked for) with that of a relevant peer group, they became noticeably more motivated to improve."
