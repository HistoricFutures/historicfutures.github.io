excerpt: >-Just over 20 months ago the Modern Slavery Act (MSA) came into effect in the UK. It was widely hailed as a timely piece of legislation to address the (almost anachronistic) problem of slavery and human trafficking in the 21st century. By targeting supply chains, the act aims to ensure that businesses neither fuel demand for slave/forced labour, nor put consumers in a position where they purchase goods produced by workers under duress (McClean, 2015).
