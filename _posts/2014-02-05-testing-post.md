excerpt: "I’ve spent much of the last 20 years working with international brands and retailers on ways to understand where products come from. How did the everyday things that we buy get here and from where? It seems a simple enough question and yet for the vast majority of things we buy it is completely unanswerable. The label may say “made in China” or wherever, but normally that’s just where the bits and pieces were put together so where do the bits come from, and how do we find out?"
