We are looking for a permanent, full time Python developer to join the team building our new supply chain visibility tool String3 - [getstring3.com](http://getstring3.com/) and the Online Claims Platform we run in partnership with the Forest Stewardship Council [ocp.fsc.org](https://ocp.fsc.org/login.html)

String3 is a tool designed for brands and retailers to ask questions about where and how their products were made. It works by connecting up the suppliers involved in making a product (anonymously), allowing questions to be asked and responses provided from the relevant organisations involved in the product transformation process.

It’s built in Python (specifically Django) running on Postgres, we do BDD using Selenium and Behave (which we’re pushing the edges of a bit and upstreaming patches as we go), deployed to AWS through Docker. There are a few other bits and pieces as well. 

We’re a small team who work in a fairly straightforward Agile (specifically Scrum) way. Even though we’re fully remote and all in different places you’ll be working closely with other team members through Slack and Google Hangouts, talking about Trello cards during the whole cycle: we don’t really do coding in a cave for 2 weeks. We get together every 6-8 weeks for a few days, usually in or around Oxford. 

Please get in contact with us if this is up your street.

STRICTLY NO RECRUITMENT AGENCIES PLEASE
