We are looking for a usability researcher to help us create a usability testing plan for our new supply chain visibility tool String3.

String3 is a tool designed for brands and retailers to ask questions about where and how their products were made. It works by connecting up the suppliers involved in making a product (anonymously), allowing questions to be asked and responses provided from the relevant organisations involved in the product transformation process. 

We are about to launch String3 after a period of piloting and testing, and although our process is very much user-focused,  we’re now looking to improve our usability testing and hope to find a usability researcher (no design requirements needed) to help us with 1) a study design and 2) analysis of our existing data. 

We’re thinking this is likely to need a significant number of days over a 6-8 week period, but with a view for longer-term implementation of the plan after this initial phase. 

We’re hoping to start work by the start of November (or earlier if you can).

Please get in contact with us if this is up your street.

STRICTLY NO RECRUITMENT AGENCIES PLEASE
