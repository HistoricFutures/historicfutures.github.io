Dear x retailer/brand

Where products come from and how they got here is important – to consumers, to business, to regulators, and to the planet. Understanding a product’s history reduces business risk and provides an important and powerful opportunity to create sustainable value.

Historic Futures Ltd (HF) are leading experts in value chain mapping. We have worked with leading brands such as M&S, FSC, Walmart and Decathlon to gather knowledge about their value chain structures and operations, enabling them to source more strategically, manage risk and communicate best practice to consumers. With over 10 years of practical, in field experience, we've learnt that creating and maintaining accurate and verifiable value chain maps is possible, but hard to do.

We've just been awarded a grant from the Technology Strategy Board to undertake further research, identify where value chain mapping is most needed and assess how we can make it easier to do. We want to adapt our existing technology (which is called String) to make it radically better.

We would welcome the opportunity to talk with you to explain the project in more detail. As part of this initial research stage, we are looking for both commercial insight into the issues around value chain mapping as well as to explore potential partnerships for piloting the new technology (in the second half of 2014).

We look forward to hearing from you, even if it's just to get some more information!
