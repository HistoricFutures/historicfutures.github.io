excerpt: "According to the 2015 UK Reputation Dividend report, 27.4% – or GBP620bn – of the total value of the UK's largest businesses (FTSE 350) was attributable to 'reputation assets'. Corporate responsibility and environmental credentials alone contributed GBP22bn to that total, a proportion that is rising year-on-year."
