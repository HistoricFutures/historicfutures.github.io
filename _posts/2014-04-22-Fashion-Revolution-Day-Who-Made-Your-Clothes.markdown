excerpt: "Fashion Revolution Day takes place this Thursday, highlighting the challenges of the fashion supply chain, from exploitation to pollution, by encouraging consumers to ask “Who made your clothes?”Historic Futures supports Fashion Revolution Day, and is one of the few organisations that offers a solution to the challenge of value chain mapping. Its world-leading ‘String’ technology makes it possible for companies to know the precise history of the products they sell - all the way from primary production to finished product - and then verify the claims they make."
