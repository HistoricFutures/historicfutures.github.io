excerpt: " Developing sustainable products for the clothing industry is easy. There are a whole raft of options for raw materials that are more sustainable that conventional raw materials; organic cotton, BCI, CMiA, recycled polyester, recycled nylon and new bio-synthetic fibres under development. Process innovations to reduce water and energy use have been developed for many aspect of the manufacturing sup0ply chain; eco-factories, ultra low liquor ratio dyeing, digital printing and plasma treatments. And we are even starting to see opportunities for the recycling of textiles to reduce waste and minimise the use of virgin materials."
